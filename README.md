# De Kringverjaardag

A horror game about the dreaded Dutch "Kringverjaardag". Join the circle and talk with AI powered guests while snacking on "kaasblokjes" and "paprika chips".

The project currently uses a local Koboldcpp instance to run the Large Language Model. Eventually, the LLM should be run in the elusive Cloud, unless that is too expensive, this is a hobby project after all.
